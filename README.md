# multiple_peaks
Code for analysis of non single peaks growth data

# Files
functions_for_heat_curves_additional_double_peak.R
    Has the functions for parameter extraction and clustering. 

1_parameter_extract.R 
    Looks at all datasets and extract characteristics like odd_peak etc

2_cluster.R
    Clusters datasets into relevant clusters and looks at strain distribution across clusters

3_analysis.R 
    Analysis of characteristics of clusters 

4_nongrowth.R
    Analysis of 4 strains with OD and CS data
    Firstly 10^5
    Then all inocula
